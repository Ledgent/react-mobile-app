## **Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes**

After making all the changes, return to your repository root (`react-mobile-app`) and commit everything:

```bash
# Ensure you are in the repository root
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Git-ting Started task with React Native mobile app"
git push origin main
